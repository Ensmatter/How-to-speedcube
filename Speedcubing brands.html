  <h3> Company 1. Gan Cube </h3>

  <p> <img src="cube gan 13.jpg" alt="Picture of Gan 13"> </p>

<p> The gan flagships are a premium line of speedcubes that deliver top notch performance. Gan cubes feel light and smooth when turning and have a good range of settings. The only thing holding them back is their price which is as crazy as their performance.

<h3> Company 2. Moyu </h3>

  <p> <img src="moyu super.jpg" alt="Picture of Moyu super rs3m" style="width:50%;height:75%;"> </p>
  <p> Moyu has two very popular lines of speedcubes, number 1 being the wr m series which was also a very smooth cube that performed well however if you had sloppy execution of algorithims it would fall apart. The wrm cubes are risk reward cubes that are exceptional in the hands of experienced cubers. Moyus other line was the rs3m, which started of as a exceptional budget cube that once set up could rival premium flagships and has evolved into a slightly more expensive yet higher quality cube. Both lines of cubes are very good and worth their respective price tag.

    <h3> Company 3. X-man </h3>

    <p> <img src="xman v3.jpg" alt="Picture of X-man tornado v3" style="width:45%;height:70%;"> </p>

  <p>

    X-man cubes have seen a lot of evolution since the first version. Now, the X-man v3 pioneer is essetially a gan cube but cheaper. Both the X-man v3 and Gan 13 have exceptional performance and the only highly noticable difference is that one feels like a X-man and the other feels like a Gan so it comes down to personal preference.
